# Practical Lab 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression, Non-Parametric Models and Cross-Validation

---

This lab focuses on multivariate regression modeling using the **Diabetes dataset** provided by Scikit-Learn. We explore different algorithms including **Polynomial Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **k-Nearest Neighbors**, along with appropriate data splitting, evaluation metrics, and model comparison.

## Objectives

---

- Load and understand the diabetes dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()`.
- Frame the machine learning problem: predicting diabetes disease progression one year after baseline.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) including statistics, visualizations, and correlation matrices.
- Train and evaluate:
  - **Univariate Polynomial Regression** on BMI feature (degrees 0 to 5).
  - **Multivariate Polynomial Regression** (degrees 2 and 3).
  - **Decision Tree Regressors** with varying max depths.
  - **kNN Regressors** with different values of k.
- Evaluate model performance using **RÂ²**, **MAE**, and **MAPE** on train, validation, and test sets.
- Draw conclusions based on validation/test results and model complexity.
- Practice clear documentation, markdown explanation, and code readability.
